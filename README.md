HumbleNetwork
=============

It's a library to help build network services based in sockets. It offers a client and a server class and a stream helper. See the example:

<pre>
public class Program
{
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		var server = new HumbleServer();
		server.AddCommand("echo", () => new EchoCommand());
		server.Start(0);

		var client = new HumbleClient();
		client.Connect("localhost", server.Port);
		client.Send("echo").Send("hello world");

		Console.WriteLine("Client received: " + client.Receive());
		Console.ReadKey();
	}
}

public class EchoCommand : ICommand
{
	public void Execute(IHumbleStream stream)
	{
		stream.Send(stream.Receive());
	}
}
</pre>

TODO
----

* Build script
* Continous Integration
* Accept send and receive stream
* Work with other types of data
* Send and receive file
* Server wait for command using async on streams
* Server works with async on streams
* Stream send command method
* Client close or disconnect method
* Control connected clients
